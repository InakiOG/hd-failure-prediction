## Notebooks

This folder contains Jupyter notebooks for data exploration, visualization, and experimentation.

- **data_cleanup**: Cleans data to improve model performance.
- **hd_classification_anomaly_detection**: Tests various machine learning models and feature selection for anomaly detection.
- **CT**: Classification tree notebook. For best results on failed drives, use a larger sample and apply SMOTE.
- **models**: Experiments with classification tree implementations.
- **RNN_HDD**: Implements a recurrent neural network (RNN) for hard drive data.
- **RNN**: RNN implementation based on GeeksForGeeks examples.

## Python Files

- **hard_drive_info**: Saves SMART data to CSV and prints it.
- **hdd_test_v2**: Retrieves SMART data and stores it; currently used for Intel HDDs.
- **RNN_HDD**: RNN implementation for hard drive data.
- **smart**: LSTM using SMART data (work in progress).
- **test_lstm_cosine**: LSTM test to predict sine and cosine.
- **test_lstm**: LSTM test to predict sine.
